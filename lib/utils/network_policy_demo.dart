/// Demo file showing Network Policy - Wi-Fi Only Media Fetch functionality
/// This should NOT be included in production builds - it's for development/testing only
library;

/// Example usage of NetworkGuard for different scenarios:

import '../services/network_utils.dart';
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

/// Example 1: Check if heavy asset should load
Future<void> checkAssetLoadingPolicy() async {
  // User has Wi-Fi only preference enabled
  final wifiOnlyPref = true;
  final assetUrl = 'https://example.com/hero-image-1mb.jpg';

  final shouldLoad = await NetworkGuard.shouldLoadHeavyAsset(
    wifiOnlyPref: wifiOnlyPref,
    assetKey: assetUrl,
  );

  debugPrint('Should auto-load asset: $shouldLoad');

  // Force load after user tap
  final canForceLoad = await NetworkGuard.shouldLoadHeavyAsset(
    wifiOnlyPref: wifiOnlyPref,
    assetKey: assetUrl,
    forceLoad: true,
  );

  debugPrint('Can force load: $canForceLoad');
}

/// Example 2: Check network status
Future<void> checkNetworkStatus() async {
  final isWifi = await NetworkGuard.isWifi();
  final isCellular = await NetworkGuard.isCellular();
  final hasConnection = await NetworkGuard.hasConnectivity();
  final statusString = await NetworkGuard.getConnectionStatus();

  debugPrint('Wi-Fi: $isWifi');
  debugPrint('Cellular: $isCellular');
  debugPrint('Has connection: $hasConnection');
  debugPrint('Status: $statusString');
}

/// QA Test Scenarios:

/// 1. Wi-Fi Connection Test:
///    - Connect device to Wi-Fi
///    - Open color story with hero image
///    - Expected: Image loads immediately, no overlay
///
/// 2. Cellular + Wi-Fi Only ON Test:
///    - Connect device to cellular data only
///    - Enable "Wi-Fi only for media" in settings
///    - Open color story with hero image
///    - Expected: Shows "Tap to load on cellular" overlay
///    - Tap overlay → image loads
///
/// 3. Cellular + Wi-Fi Only OFF Test:
///    - Connect device to cellular data only
///    - Disable "Wi-Fi only for media" in settings
///    - Open color story with hero image
///    - Expected: Image loads immediately
///
/// 4. Session Override Test:
///    - Start with cellular + Wi-Fi only ON
///    - Tap to load one image
///    - Navigate to another story with same image URL
///    - Expected: Same image loads immediately (session override)
///
/// 5. Audio Network Policy Test:
///    - Connect device to cellular data only
///    - Enable "Wi-Fi only for media" in settings
///    - Open story with audio
///    - Expected: Shows audio blocked overlay with "Load Audio" button
///
/// 6. Connection Change Test:
///    - Start on cellular with Wi-Fi only ON
///    - See tap-to-load overlay
///    - Switch to Wi-Fi
///    - Expected: Overlays disappear, assets load automatically

/// Network Policy Implementation Checklist:

/// ✅ NetworkGuard utility class
/// ✅ Session-based override tracking
/// ✅ Network status detection (Wi-Fi, cellular, ethernet)
/// ✅ NetworkAwareImage widget with tap-to-load overlay
/// ✅ NetworkAwareAudio widget with load button
/// ✅ GradientFallbackHero integration
/// ✅ ColorPlanDetailScreen integration
/// ✅ ExploreScreen ColorStoryCard integration
/// ✅ User preference loading from Firebase
/// ✅ Heavy asset threshold (>500KB assumption)
/// ✅ Session override clearing on app start

/// Performance Considerations:
/// - Network checks are cached within NetworkGuard
/// - Session overrides prevent repeated user prompts
/// - Fallback gradients render instantly (<100ms)
/// - Connectivity stream available for real-time updates

/// User Experience:
/// - Clear "Tap to load on cellular" messaging
/// - Connection status indicator in overlays
/// - One-time per session override behavior
/// - Graceful fallbacks for connection issues
